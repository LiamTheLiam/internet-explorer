# internet-explorer
### What I did

I went into a **_Windows 7_** desktop, and saved the Internet Explorer files from C:\Program Files and C:\Program Files x86 (Also Appdata files)

I doubt that it will run, but, if the files are at all useful, use them.

### How to use _(probably won't work)_

Put the AppData files in their corresponding folders and to use the 32-bit version put the **Program Files (x86)** files into the **C:\Program Files x86** folder and **Program Files** in **C:\Program Files** for 64-bit.

### _THE END_
